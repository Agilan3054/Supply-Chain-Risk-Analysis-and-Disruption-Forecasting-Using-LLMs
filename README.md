# Supply Chain Risk Analysis and Disruption Forecasting Using LLMs

## Project Overview

This project develops an automated system to analyze unstructured data from global news articles and supplier reports, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect supply chain disruptions. The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and graph theory to generate actionable risk insights for decision-makers in supply chain management.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Transformers** (Hugging Face)
- **SpaCy** (for Named Entity Recognition)
- **NetworkX** (for graph construction and analysis)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizing graphs)
- **Streamlit** (for deploying the interactive dashboard)
- **News API** (for data collection)

## Features

- Automated extraction and analysis of news articles related to supply chain disruptions.
- Implementation of NLP techniques including Named Entity Recognition (NER) and summarization using pre-trained LLMs (e.g., BART, T5).
- Visualization of supply chain dependencies using graph algorithms to identify interconnected risks.
- User-friendly interface for proactive risk management strategies.
